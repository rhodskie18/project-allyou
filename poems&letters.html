            <h2>With Affection, Without Expectations</h2>
            <p>With all my affection,</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I lately find myself having vigorous impulses to merely talk to you. The first thing I see is your name on my phone, and suddenly, I’ve already said “Hi” despite not knowing what to say next. Even when I have nothing to talk about, I seem to invent topics out of nowhere, just for the possibility of a conversation</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Now, I won’t call this love—because I know it’s too early for me, for you, and for both of us. What I am certain of, though, is that I enjoy our developing relationship. That’s why, regardless of me not calling this love, I am sure this is some sort of affection. What that is, I do not know.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Do I like you already? Maybe. Does that scare you, dear sweet one? Does this confession of uncertainty make you afraid of continuing this adventure with me? Please trust me. I mean no harm with my intentions. I do not desire anything more than to keep this relationship with you uninterrupted and continuous. To see what there is to see. To seek a possibility. To find out what may be for us.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Will you follow me?</p>

            <h2>Seeds of Affection</h2>
            <p>As I sit and think of you,</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I ponder how you would handle and take care of a flower if you were given one. Would you tend to it carefully, ensuring it has the right nutrients to flourish, or would you ignore its potential beauty by disregarding it? People often focus on the end result of a bloom’s inception, but forget that the process of growth is just as important as the final flower.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">You see, I am not like people. If I were to care for a flower, I would relish its growth, appreciating how its present state unfolds into something greater with time. I would watch as the seeds sprout and the petals begin to show, and only when the flower dies would my care for it end.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">And so I wonder, dear one, would you tend to these feelings of mine as you would a flower? Would you nurture them with the same care, watching them evolve into something beautiful over time, or would you let them wither away?</p>

            <h2>A Smile</h2>
            <p>With warmth and regret,</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I am stupid and foolish. I forgot your smile and face from our date. My pitiful memory has become an obstacle to a supposedly enjoyable result of a date. It’s a tragedy as I see your smile as worth as that day’s experience. I regret not ingraining your smile in the deepest crevices of my mind.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I can’t help but feel like I’ve missed something incredibly precious by not holding onto that moment, a moment I now long to relive. Your smile is something I wished that would make me stay up at night and smile. Now it’s a shooting star that I’ve let slip past by without capturing its beauty, and I can’t help but ache of not having captured your smile to memory.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I’ve replayed that evening in my mind, wishing for a chance to see your smile again, to remember it in its full beauty. But more than that, I wish for another opportunity—one where I can truly appreciate every detail and let it stay with me forever.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">If you would let me, I would love the chance to see you again. To not only remember your smile but to make new memories, where my heart can be fully present. Would you be open to that? I can only hope that we can meet again, and this time, I’ll make sure your smile stays etched in my mind.</p>

            <h2>Weight of Hesitation</h2>
            <p>There are words I held back,</p>
            <p>Not because I didn’t want to say them,</p>
            <p>But because I didn’t know how they’d land—</p>
            <p>Uncertainty wrapped in every syllable,</p>
            <p>Wondering if they’d be met with warmth</p>
            <p>Or silence,</p>
            <p>With understanding</p>
            <p>Or a quiet distance.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">So I stayed silent,</p>
            <p>Watching the moments pass,</p>
            <p>The words gathering weight in my chest—</p>
            <p>Heavy, but not yet spoken.</p>
            <p>I wondered:</p>
            <p>What would they mean to you?</p>
            <p>Would they change anything,</p>
            <p>Or would they just float in the air,</p>
            <p>Unheard, unnoticed, underground,</p>
            <p>Like things that never reach the surface of the ground?</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I hesitated,</p>
            <p>Not out of doubt,</p>
            <p>But out of fear of the unknown—</p>
            <p>Afraid that what was meant to bring us closer</p>
            <p>Might push us further apart.</p>
            <p>Yet somewhere within,</p>
            <p>I know silence can only hold so much.</p>
            <p>The weight will fade,</p>
            <p>The words will eventually find their way out.</p>
            <p>For courage, like a seed</p>
            <p>Needs only a moment to sprout.</p>

            <h2>Haven of Admiration</h2>
            <p>Dear Haven of my Admiration,</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I confess, this admiration I hold for you has grown into something deeper. I wonder—perhaps it’s too soon to speak of such things. Maybe it’s too soon for you. But in these days we’ve shared, I’ve found myself inspired, motivated by the thought of you. It’s exhilarating trying to show you the best of myself, to make sure I present myself in a suitable way.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">But I can’t help but wonder, do I trouble you? Could I be a pest, maybe unintentionally? What if you find yourself hesitating, unsure of what to make of me and my intentions?</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Still, this admiration is not fleeting. It’s growing. And while I understand the hesitation of some people talking about their feelings—when they question how they can express their emotions—I must admit that the impulse to share my feelings has become hard to ignore. The last thing I want is to make you uncomfortable.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">There are many ways I could express myself to you. Through words, actions, even silence, I’m learning how to show you just how much I’m serious. Writing these letters, creating these words for you—they are just a few of the ways I can offer a piece of myself, a way to deepen our connection. I can only hope that you might accept them as a step towards something more.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">With patience and care, I hope we can continue exploring this bond, no matter where it leads.</p>

        <p>hi, i really only wanted to do a small project but lacked the motivation. i was thinking of you when i was planning for this project so i thought, “why not?”. nothing cringe or weird, it was just a coincidence. i also want to add more letters and poems in the future so hopefully it’s something you look forward to…? it’s not much but i tried my best. anyway, enjoy!</p>
